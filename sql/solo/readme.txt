Guide to database setup for the "solo" fork of TrinityCore.

Start by installing TDB. I used base version 29 and update 32, the latest version supporting WoW 3.3.3a.

Then apply alter.creature_template.sql and eliteFactors.sql.

The eliteFactors list is far from complete. In-game, use the ".nerf" command to fix unhandled creatures.

If you want to update the eliteFactors.sql file, you can use export.eliteFactors.sql.

End of Line.
