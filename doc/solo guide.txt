Useful commands when playing in solo mode.
Any base commands by themselves give a list of subcommands.
For more details, and a searchable list of commands, use the Source. Specifically, Chat.cpp.

All commands can be shortened to their lowest uncommon denominator.
For example, ".lookup creature" can be rendered ".lo c". ".quest complete" becomes ".q c".


.help [base-command]		// Get a list of all available commands [or sub-commands].

.lookup				// Find the id of something that you know the name of.
.lookup item <name>
.lookup quest <name>
.lookup creature <name>
.lookup skill <name>
.lookup object <name>
.lookup spell <name>

.tele
.tele <wherever>		// Teleport you
.lookup tele [pattern]		// Show a list of teleport destinations
.tele add <new name>		// Add a new destination
.tele del <careful...>		// Delete a destination

.mod speed <factor>		// Change your running speed. Default is 1.
.mod aspeed <factor>		// Change all speeds (swimming, riding, flying). Default is 1.

.additem <id> [amount]		// Add one or more items into your backpack
.setskill <skill-id> <skill-level>	// Increase a skill-line, like Alchemy or Swords.

.gm icast on			// Reduces cast time for all spells to zero. Most useful for slow crafting skills.
.gm icast off			// Restores cast time to normal.

.cast <spellid>			// Cast a spell
Note: trainer spell IDs can be difficult to find, as the spells have different names from the skills they teach, for example: "Artisan Tailor", without the "ing".

Useful spells:
.cast 22700			// Summon Repairbot. This bot will repair your gear, and buy any item. Useful on long treks and in dungeons, when your bags are full.
.cast 47883			// Soulstone Resurrection. For 15 minutes, you can self-resurrect in case of death. Beware, however: if you resurrect close to an enemy, they will attack you again!
.cast 130 triggered		// Slow Fall. Useful if you like to jump off high cliffs.

.unaura <spellid>		// Remove an aura(buff/debuff) from yourself. Useful if you get stuck with something like "Compelled" (48714).

.reset talents			// Reset talents, for free.

.mod rep <factionId> <value>	// Modifies your standing reputation with a faction.
.lookup faction <name>

.gm on				// Turns on non-combat mode. Creatures will not attack you, and you cannot harm them.
.gm off				// Turns off non-combat mode, restoring normality.

.combatstop			// Leave combat. Useful if you're stuck in combat due to a bug. Useless if an enemy is nearby.

.die				// Kills targeted NPC. You don't get credit unless you've dealt enough damage.

.quest
.quest add <qid>		// Starts a quest, if possible.
.quest complete <qid>		// Finishes a quest, if you haven't already done it. You'll still have to turn it in.

.npc
.npc info			// Shows info about selected NPC.
.respawn			// Respawns ALL nearby creatures AND objects. Or, if you have a selected NPC, just that NPC is respawned.
.npc tempadd <creatureid>	// Spawns a temporary clone NPC at your position. It does not leave a corpse when killed, so no loot.
.npc add <creatureid>		// Spawns a new clone NPC at your position. WARNING: This is permanent. Clean up with .npc del.
.npc del			// Deletes selected NPC permanently. Works on corpses, summons and tempadds, too.

.list creature <creatureid>	// Shows a list of all creatures of the specified type on your current map. Useful for finding that rare spawn.

.bank				// Access your bank account, from anywhere in the game world.

.gobject
.gobject target			// Shows info about the closest game-object, like a door or a chest.
.gobject activate <guid>	// Activates an object.
.gobject add <gobjectid>	// Permanently spawns a new game-object.

.nerf				// Shows the nerf-factor of the selected NPC. Default is 1.0. The nerf-factor should be the number of players required to defeat the NPC in standard WoW.
.nerf <newFactor>		// Set the nerf-factor of the selected NPC. Please use .nerf first to see if it's been set already.



For game-masters:
.summon <name>			// Teleports character <name> to your position. Also resurrects the dead.
.appear <name>			// Teleports you to character <name>. If character is dead, teleports you to her ghost, although you cannot see ghosts if you're alive, unless GM mode is on.
